                <p>For his new release 'Charity' Joseph wanted to capture the eerie feeling of his living quaters in Vietnam. Many of the shots involving shadows were based on his own experiences in his dark windowless room. The script was translated into Vietnamese by the talented Phan Quoc Anh. </p>
<p><br>Whilst preparing for the shoot, there were a couple of oversights. Joseph left the props to the last minute so he ended up paying through the nose for the mask. </p>
<p><br>Joseph also had trouble in his search for string. He traveled to every corner of Ho Chi Minh city in search for string, stopping in and chatting to the proprietors of many craft shops around the city, but was unable to find any string.</p>
<p>Joseph, however, had a stoke of luck! He asked his ever-faithful friend Callum Caddell to hold the mask onto the actor and pretend to be an extra set of arms. </p>

                <p>Joseph has recently starred in the final film (During Uni) of fellow director 'Alex Fletcher'. This film was quite wild, he was brought in last second with many mishaps occuring. A group of freinds is summoned by a magical wizard who wishes to make the boys drink his 'wizard seed', this was very very strange indeed.</p>
<p>The scene where the second wizard arrives was origionally supposed to have a hostage trapped in the boot of the wizard's car. Also, there were little elf hats we were initially supposed to wear but it was unfortunately decided against to the sadness of many people.</p>

<p>However, the most exciting thing for him was the pre-arranged meeting with artist 'C.M.Kosemen' author of 'All Tommorows' which Joseph had arranged. They talked for hours whilst Kosemen created art for Joseph's family and freinds. </p>
<p>This was such an amazing city, Joseph wishes he could've stayed there forever.</p>

                <p>Finally, after months of misery, Joseph has left Vietnam for good. However he knows that there are many things he'll miss. Grab racing, cheap and cool transport, temples everywhere, koi fish cafe's, Iguanas everywhere and the feeling of independance that living in another country gave him.</p>
<p>On his last night, he sat outside by the temple and sampled 10 mins of audio recording from by the road for future projects. He also got a sneaky tattoo before he left. </p>
<p>It was time for Joseph to return home (via Turkey) to all the things he missed: freinds, family, Iceland 3 for £3 deal, Wetherspoons 3 small plates for £13 deal, his pets and of course his camera equipment.</p>

                <p>In the last leg of my trip, Joseph went to Indonesia. Possibly the best accomodation in Asia he's ever experienced. On the second day, Joseph and Christian went to the beach where a bunch of Indonesian kids kept asking questions such as 'Do you like Apples?' 'Do you like Cats?' and various other flavours of that question. Joseph also had the worst fish and chips of his life on that beach. </p>
<p>He and Christian then ventured (On a guided tour) to a tea plantation and an active volacano. Volcanoes stink, they are absolutely aweful on the nose. Joseph nearly bought a blow-dart from a volcano woman and he's glad he didn't because they're illegal in the UK (Who knew). Afterwards, he and Christian retired to a Volcanic spar where they got their feet nice and massaged.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this was to be the last night before Christian headed back to Finland, so they grabbed a random Indonesian man called Ricky and went to a swinging 20's themed jazz/pizza bar and the three of them had a wonderful candlelit dinner.</p>

                <p>Joseph has created a film challange using four directors who all work different parts on 4 different films. A bit confusing but fun.</p>
<p>Joseph's mind was swimming when he got this script, his first decision was to cast Ben Hillyer as Lane, unfortunatley Ben wasn't avaliable but that didn't stop him. This was also the first(ish, if you don't count Fictus Medicus) film where Joseph used body doubles. Unfortunately for Lane's apartment which was supposed to be covered in empty alcohol bottles, Joseph couldn't find any.  However, he made the quick decision that the character had auto-brewery syndrome, causing the bread that Joseph strew about to turn into alcohol in the character's stomach.</p>

He wanted to make a film that would make people come up with their own interpretations on the ending, the. It also bothered Joseph, the amount of sappy short films where two strangers bond over shared loss or trauma, which felt very cookie-cutter. This film was meant as the inverse of this trope; yes, they are both experiencing loss, however the characters strongly dislike one-another and the Boatman desperately wants this disrespectful stranger to just bugger off.</p>
